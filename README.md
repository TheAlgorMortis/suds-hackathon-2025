### Project description

#### Who we are üêøÔ∏è

This is a platform designed for users to help each other make informed choices for their module selections at Stellenbosch University, share advice for modules, as well as connect with students and tutors.

#### A modern replacement for the Stellenbosch Yearbook üìñ

Have you ever found yourself struggling to decide what modules to take? You may be debating electives, or stuggling to find and cross reference requisites.

Maroonut aims to take this struggle away by doing all that work for you. All you have to do is search for the module you're considering, and you'll have everything you ever wanted to know.

Beside the module descriptions, requisites are displayed with links to the pages of the corresponding modules to make them easy to navigate.

To get started, sign in and navigate to the Modules page of this website.

#### The Module Rate and Review System üå∞

Wondering how the modules get their ratings?

On Maroonut, users who have taken modules can post reviews on them, including their overall rating of the module. The incentive is that users can share their experience beyond what is shared in the module framework to help prospective students find out more about what they can really expect to gain from the module. Users can complain about their lecturers, rave about the practicals, or say whatever they want.

To mitigate the detriments of free speech, a voting system allows users to give or steal "acorns" to or from that review. Reviews with more acorns are higher up on the list, and more credible, as users will give acorns to reviews that are more helpful and agreeable, forcing the unhelpful reviews to sink to the bottom of the list.

As a comparison, this works the same way as Reddit's upvote and downvote system.

#### Finding Tutors üéì

One of Maroonut's primary goals is to connect students with tutors.

On each module's page, users can find tutors, who market themselves through Maroonut. Students can enquire these tutors via a button that will allow them to email the tutor.

#### User Profiles üë§

Each review and tutor advert also allows you to visit the reviewer or tutor's user profile, which provides information like their academic performance, total net acorns received on any reviews, their ratings on their modules, and the modules that they tutor for.

This allows you to keep up with reviewers and tutors you trust and respect.
